# Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN) Classifier from Scratch with NumPy

This repository provides an educational implementation of a fully connected neural network (FNN) classifier using only NumPy. The implementation is highly customizable, allowing users to specify the number and size of hidden layers, various activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh), and optimization techniques (Gradient Descent, Momentum, Adam). It also supports L2 regularization and mini-batch training.
